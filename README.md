# JavaUtil
A collection of Java Utilities such as
1) Collections: ArrayLists, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
2) Very basic File utilities: Write, Read
3) A Logger Class.
4) A few classes to check arguments: IndexChecks, StateChecks
5) Data Structures: Graph, BSTree, AVLTree, HashTable, PriorityQueue

I do it just to lear, so don't expect anyserious stuff here.
Still working on it :p
